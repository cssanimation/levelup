Steps: 

- Show the HTML
- Initial CSS empty using browser default styling for the links to begin with

- Set text decoration none (why)
- Add border-bottom: .1em solid blue; - see how it's too low
- Instead add a pseudo element:
  a {
    text-decoration: none;
    position: relative;
  }

  a:after {
    content: "";
    position: absolute;
    left: 0;
    right: 0;
    bottom: .14em;
    border-top: .1em solid blue;
  }

- Looks the same as the link unstyled
- But since it's a border we can do more, such as border-radius
- Show border radius 50% for a wedge shape
- Adjust back to 1em to match the rounded style of our text border-radius: 1em;

- Animating the pseudo element
- First get rid of the underline on hover
- Add in the :hover:after block positioning right: 0
- Add in the transition transition: all .4s cubic-bezier(0,.5,0,1);
- Note that we're animating the "left" and "right" attributes - this is often dangerous especially if it means making pages adjust their layouts. In this case though...

- Add in a colour animation - first add color and border-color to the two elements
- Add transition to the anchor block itself
- Add in a hover colour and a hover:after border colour, then add a transition for the border colour to match the anchor transition

- Sert up keyframes for a simple left to right animation
- Explain about how multiple percentages represent a "pause" in the keyframes

    a:hover:after {
      animation: anchor-underline 2s cubic-bezier(0,.5,0,1) infinite;
      border-color: #457DFB;
    }

    @keyframes anchor-underline {
      0%, 10% {
        left: 0;
      }
      40%, 60% {
        left: 0;
        right: 0;
      }
      90%, 100% {
        right: 0;
        left: 100%;
      }
    }
