Set up some examples that demonstrate the following:

- When a user scrolls to a certain point, trigger an animation
- Fading in content as a user scrolls down page
- Animating the scrolling to a certain point on a page
- Adding parallax effects when scrolling
- Triggering a one-time animation when the user reaches the bottom of the page (investigate requestAnimationFrame for this)

Scrolling stuff

Showing an image in the content on scroll, like in Wired.com articles
Triggering an animation using http://scrollmagic.io 
Parallax: rellax https://github.com/dixonandmoe/rellax`
This: Home-spun parallax based on requestAnimationFrame to add a parallax effect to one section of the site? (Rellax relies on the entire page context)
Or this: CSS only parallax https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/12/performant-parallaxing
