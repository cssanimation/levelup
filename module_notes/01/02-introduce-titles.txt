Section 2: Animate the content pieces

Set up the pop-in animation
Apply to all elements in the content
Set up a bouncy cubic bezier
Set delays (start with like 1s, 1.5, 2, 2.2)
Tweak to fit the timing of the background
Explain how the timings work together to introduce the elements

Final touch, introduce the cut off angle at the end
Build the simple keyframes for rotate-up
Apply to the "after" pseudo element and adjust the starting transform
Add delay so that it occurs at the same time as the background animates in

Show the effect - pretty slick. But one thing missing, needs a cue to scroll down the page
