<h1>Introducing the titles</h1>

<p>So far we've set the scene for our animated landing page with the background image. We've seen how to add and animate pseudo-elements, and even delved into custom timing functions. Let's take that further.</p>

<p>In this lesson we'll animate in the content on top, and take the opportunity to experiment more with bouncy timung functions, animation choreography and creating reusable sets of keyframes.</p>

<h2>Making it pop</h2>

<p>Like in the choreography you see in stage performances and dances, we're going to think about how all the various pieces of content in our hero header move together. We could have the elements slide in to place like the background image, which would show a nice connectedness between the elements. Let's also take it a little further by making each of the elements seem to "pop" out of the screen.</p>

<p>To begin we'll create some <code>keyframes</code> for the animation. Within the <code>keyframes</code> container, we want "0%" and "100%" frames, representing the beginning and end states of the animation.</p>

<pre><code>@keyframes pop-in {
  0% {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateY(-4rem) scale(.8);
  }
  100% {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: none;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Initially the content will be invisible, so we're setting <code>opacity</code> to 0. To mirror the movement of the background, we'll also use a <code>transform</code> to <code>translate</code> the position of the content up by 4em. Lastly we're adding a new transform. We're scaling the size down to 0.8 in the starting frame.</p>

<p>This means that when the animation starts the elements will be a little smaller, and by the end will have animated to their normal size. Let's see how we apply this to the content.</p>

<h2>Moving the elements</h2>

<p>We can now apply these keyframes to our content. However rather than adding an <code>animation</code> property to each element one at a time, let's take this opportunity to set up a reusable class for the animation. If we have create a new class called <code>animate-pop-in</code>, we can then have this apply the animation more efficiently.</p>

<p>To get started, in the HTML, we add this class to each of the content items we want to animate.</p>

<pre><code>... other HTML ...
&lt;section class="header-content"&gt;
  &lt;img class="rocky-dashed animate-pop-in" src="images/rocky-dashed.svg"&gt;
  &lt;h1 class="header-title animate-pop-in"&gt;Your awesome landing page&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;h3 class="header-subtitle animate-pop-in"&gt;A useful start for your projects&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p class="header-button animate-pop-in"&gt;&lt;a href="#calls-to-action" class="button"&gt;Get started today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
... other HTML ...
</code></pre>

<p>We've added the <code>animate-pop-in</code> class to the image, headings and paragraph text. Now we can make use of that in our CSS. Here's what we add to our CSS.</p>

<pre><code>.animate-pop-in {
  animation: pop-in .6s ease-out forwards;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This applies the animation <code>pop-in</code> to every element. It's making them appear with a duration of .6 seconds, and using that old <code>ease-out</code> timing function.</p>

<p data-height="600" data-theme-id="light" data-slug-hash="MpbRLd" data-default-tab="result" data-user="donovanh" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Landing page with animated foreground elements (not staggered)" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/donovanh/pen/MpbRLd/">Landing page with animated foreground elements (not staggered)</a>.</p>

<p>It's a start! But we can do better.</p>

<h2>Choreography</h2>

<p>Currently the content elements are popping in while the page is still blank. When we built our background animation, we made use of the <code>animation-delay</code> property. This meant the background waited for .5 seconds before the animation began.</p>

<p>Let's add some delays to our content items so that they show up after the background has started to appear. </p>

<p>Before we start adding delays, we set out which elements we're going to style.</p>

<pre><code>.rocky-dashed {

}

.header-title {

}

.header-subtitle {

}

.header-button {

}
</code></pre>

<p>These 4 elements will need to appear, one at a time. Thankfully we don't need to put in the entire <code>animation</code> property for each, as these elements already have the <code>animate-pop-in</code> class. We'll just specify a delay on each one. Since the background animation takes about a second to get going, let's start these off with a delay of 1 second and increase it for each element.</p>

<pre><code>.rocky-dashed {
  animation-delay: 1s;
}

.header-title {
  animation-delay: 1.2s;
}

.header-subtitle {
  animation-delay: 1.4s;
}

.header-button {
  animation-delay: 1.6s;
}
</code></pre>

<p>We also need to set these elements to be invisible on load, to avoid the flash where they're visible then they animate after a delay. Set the opacity on the "animate-pop-in" element.</p>

<pre><code>.animate-pop-in {
  animation: pop-in .6s ease-out forwards;
  opacity: 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>So let's see the result. We've added a delay that starts at 1 second, then each item waits a further .2 seconds before starting. When we look at the result we see the animations staggered.</p>

<p data-height="600" data-theme-id="light" data-slug-hash="mWOYbp" data-default-tab="result" data-user="donovanh" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Landing page with animated foreground elements (staggered1)" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/donovanh/pen/mWOYbp/">Landing page with animated foreground elements (staggered1)</a>.</p>

<p>It might just be my opinion but I reckon these seem to be appearing just a little bit late. Let's go back through and change the numbers so they start at .6s instead.</p>

<pre><code>.rocky-dashed {
  animation-delay: .6s;
}

.header-title {
  animation-delay: .8s;
}

.header-subtitle {
  animation-delay: 1s;
}

.header-button {
  animation-delay: 1.1s;
}
</code></pre>

<p>On second thoughts, let's make that last item, the <code>header-button</code> appear a little more closely with just a .1 second gap. It should now all feel a bit tighter.</p>

<p data-height="600" data-theme-id="light" data-slug-hash="ryWgaV" data-default-tab="result" data-user="donovanh" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Landing page with animated foreground elements (staggered2)" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/donovanh/pen/ryWgaV/">Landing page with animated foreground elements (staggered2)</a>.</p>

<p>That's better. It's a good idea to take time to tweak things like animation delays and timing functions by eye. Sometimes an animation won't feel right and it might just be a question of messing around with the timings until it all works together.</p>

<p>So, now we have a staggered animation. It's looking pretty good, but the way the animation ends feels a little flat. Let's see if we can bring some life to this little animation with a more bouncy timing function.</p>

<h2>Bounciness</h2>

<p>Time to replace that old <code>ease-out</code> timing function with something more interesting. Over on <a href="http://cubic-bezier.com">Cubic-Bezier.com</a> we'll create a curve that starts fast but then shoots right past the top and settles back to the finishing point. Place first point on the left axis near the top to give it that fast start, then the second point above the top line. The resulting curve should be a long steep arc that tapers back at the end.</p>

<p><img src="https://cssanimation.rocks/levelup/public/images/01/bezier02.png" alt="A bezier curve with points 0, .9, .3, 1.2" title="" /></p>

<p>Taking the coordinates and putting them into our animation property now looks like this.</p>

<pre><code>animation: pop-in .6s cubic-bezier(0, 0.9, 0.3, 1.2) forwards;
</code></pre>

<p>Let's see how that looks.</p>

<p data-height="600" data-theme-id="light" data-slug-hash="xqRNwE" data-default-tab="result" data-user="donovanh" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Landing page with animated foreground elements (staggered and cubic bezier)" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/donovanh/pen/xqRNwE/">Landing page with animated foreground elements (staggered and cubic bezier)</a>.</p>

<p>It's starting to look a lot better now. </p>

<h2>Pieces working together</h2>

<p>The purpose of this choreography is to not only to look cool, but to draw attention to what we want our visitors to see. In this case it's straightforward, we want people to see the title and then have their attention drawn to the big "call to action" button in the middle.</p>

<p>There's a second goal here though, and that's to let people know that there's more content further down the page. We're going to help draw attention to that using the chevron at the bottom there, but we can add a subtle animation to the header also. Let's try our hand at a rotate <code>transform</code> by animating that big white wedge at the bottom of the screen.</p>

<h2>Animating the wedge</h2>

<p>As ever we'll create the <code>keyframes</code> for this new animation.</p>

<pre><code>@keyframes rotate-up {
  100% {
    transform: rotateZ(-4deg);
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You'll notice there's no "0%" this time. That's because it's optional. You can choose to leave out either the starting or even the ending keyframe and the browser will infer it based on the styles given to the element. In this case, it'll go from having no transform, to being rotated. We apply this by making a couple of changes to our <code>header:after</code> block.</p>

<pre><code>header:after {
  animation: rotate-up .5s .5s cubic-bezier(0, 0.5, 0, 1) forwards;
  background: #F9FCFF;
  content: "";
  height: 40rem;
  left: -5%;
  position: absolute;
    right: -5%;
    top: 90%;
  transform-origin: 0 0;
  z-index: 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>First we add the <code>animation</code> property, giving it the animation name of <code>rotate-up</code>. I've decided to make the duration just .5 seconds this time. If it's longer, it'll still be moving when the other content is appearing and that could confuse the flow. We'd like this to be a subtle animation that doesn't distract from the main content. We'll have it delayed for .5s and use the same timing function as the background image.</p>

<p>Lastly we want this to begin without any <code>transform</code>, so we remove that line. It should now use the <code>rotate-up</code> keyframes to rotate from no transform, to -4 degrees.</p>

<p data-height="600" data-theme-id="light" data-slug-hash="PpbvZB" data-default-tab="result" data-user="donovanh" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Landing page with animated foreground elements (staggered and cubic bezier and wedge)" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/donovanh/pen/PpbvZB/">Landing page with animated foreground elements (staggered and cubic bezier and wedge)</a>.</p>

<h2>Next: Adding a scroll cue</h2>

<p>In this lesson we have learned how to create and apply an animation to a class of elements, then use the <code>animation-delay</code> property to choreograph them. We'll be able to reuse this <code>animate-pop-in</code> class elsewhere without adding any extra CSS code to our project, essentially making it the beginning of our own animation library.</p>

<p>Next up, we'll delve into the art of combining multiple animations by introducing the scroll cue!</p>
