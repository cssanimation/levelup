Section 3: Adding a scroll cue

Add in new section called "down-arrow" with an image of the downarrow, 50px
Set it up to be absolute positioning, z-index to make it show
Set up keyframes for "fade-slide-up"
Only difference is the translateY
Apply it to the image within the downarrow section - so that it doesn't conflict with the positioning

Recap: We now have a nice set of co-ordinated animations, next we'll look at optimising them to make our code simpler
