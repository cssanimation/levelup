### Fixed background image

This example animates the content onto the scene as before, but affixes the background to the page. Content scrolls up in front.

### Video background

A popular use of a hero header is to affix a background video. Here's one to get you started.

### Blurry-background depth zoom

A sci-fi style header that zooms back to reveal a massive star scape. The trick is to have to images, one with the zoom effect and the second without.

### Animated gradient background

A simple effect in which two gradients rotate on top of each other. The effect is quite neat. Try changing the gradient values!
