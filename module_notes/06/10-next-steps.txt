Thoughts

- How could we approach using Sass in our project to make these files more efficient, maybe use imports in a single Sass file and link that in the head, rather than a bunch of different files
- What sorts of animations do you think the show-on-scroll JavaScript could trigger? By adding / removing a class, the possibilities are vast. You could trigger the drawing of an SVG, playing video, start or pause counters - more than just scrolling items into view
- Feedback and follow up questions - get in touch through twitter or email
