Changes

- So far we've mostly been just adding CSS - lets bring over a larger feature, the hover-animated "options" from module 2
- Copy across the "highlight.js" from 02/03-end/javascripts (create new javascripts folder if necessary)
- Add reference to jQuery 
- Copy the "options" styling and create a new file called "options.css" under components
- Reference this in the CSS
- Copy the "options" html across and paste where marked in the HTML
- In the CSS add in some styles set up in "main.css" (badge, rocky-badge, rocky-image-small)
- These styles will help the content inside these options look better
